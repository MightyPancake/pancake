# About

Pancake is a game engine built almost entirely in [Go](https://golang.org/), a programming language made by Google, which is one of the most promising languages. It uses [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) to make the games run on many different platforms and [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/), a commonly used, powerful library for GPU accelerated graphics.

# Aim

It was **heavily inspired by [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/)**, a really awesome framework I highly encourage you to try! **It is far more developed than pancake**, however, pancake aims at being expandable; if you don't have something implemented, you can implement it yourself and then share it with the community by asking for merge on [GitHub](https://github.com/MightyPancake/pancake)!

# Support

If you want to help this me with this project you can either drop me some coins or just, as mentioned above, expand the pancake and propose a new addition or improvement to pancake on [GitHub](https://github.com/MightyPancake/pancake)!
