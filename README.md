# For beginners and experienced users

Pancake is built to be extremely easy to pick up. Inspired a lot by [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/), Pancake uses [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) as it's scripting language, which makes it a perfect pick for beginners!

More experienced users might find it easier to code in Go which is also entirely possible with Pancake!
