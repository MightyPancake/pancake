# Baked for everybody!

Pancake is built to be extremely easy to pick up. Inspired a lot by [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/), Pancake uses [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) as it's scripting language, which makes it a perfect pick for beginners!

More experienced users might find it easier to code in Go which is also entirely possible with Pancake!

# Why pancake?

* Simple, flexible and expandable!
* Free and open source!
* Perfect for beginners!

# About

Pancake is a game engine built almost entirely in [Go](https://golang.org/), a programming language made by Google, which is one of the most promising languages. It uses [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) to make the games run on many different platforms and [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/), a commonly used, powerful library for GPU accelerated graphics.

It was **heavily inspired by [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/)**, a really awesome framework I highly encourage you to try! **It is far more developed than pancake**, however, pancake aims at being expandable; if you don't have something implemented, you can implement it yourself and then share it with the community by asking for merge on [github](https://github.com/MightyPancake/pancake)!
